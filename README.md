# GoonJak 🍟

**The Ultimate Recruitment Token for Wrecked Degens**

GoonJak is a deranged fast-food superhero offering jobs to crypto losers who lost everything but still won't log off. This isn't a meme. It's a lifestyle correction.

## 🚨 About GoonJak

He doesn't trade. He hunts. Forged in the back rooms of red candle caves, Goonjak is the one thing terminally online chart addicts fear most — employment.

He lurks in your tabs, watching you loop CT, lotion in hand, leverage maxed, praying for one more green wick. Too late. You've been spotted.

Powered by rage, fries, and anti-goon radiation, he drags wrecked traders from their dim-lit dens and gives them what they truly deserve: a job.
